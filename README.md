### Gradstem is a Resource Hub aggrigating and maintaing H1b sponsoring jobs for fresh graduates .

-This Application is being build specifically for New Grad International students ,we manually verify each job for 2 criterias
1.Does the job posting hire/sponsor International students
2.Does the job posting hire new grads (0-1 yr exp)

The Jobs are scrapped on daily basis from Linkedin , Indeed , Glassdoor and 2000+ company career pages known for hiring International students
The Gradstem Public API is a REST API that lets you manage all of your Gradstem services and resources through simple HTTP requests. With this API, you can have the power of OpenAI embeddings , Semantic Resume similarity search(AI Based) , allowing you to integrate seamlessly with Gradstem
Currently, the API supports endpoints that allow for Auth (access Token and Referesh Token),
Companies,Jobs,Similarity(Resume Similarity)
I'll be gradually releasing more endpoints in the coming months, allowing you to find internships , Generate Customised Coverletters and Resumes based on existing resume and job description.
